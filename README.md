## Introduction

In this portfolio, you will find a variety of machine learning projects covering different domains such as classification, regression, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. Each project comes with detailed documentation and code implementation to help you understand the methodologies and techniques used.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects included in this portfolio:

1. **Nvidia Stock Price Forecasting**
   - **Description:** Utilized Python to extract and clean 5 years of NVIDIA stock data from Yahoo Finance for price forecasting model. Designed automated scripts in Python to label weekly market data as Good and Bad Weeks to generate training data, reducing execution by 30%. Tested and built over 10 Machine Learning models to obtain the most robust model for price forecasting. Applied Regression and Machine learning to make inferences on unlabeled weekly data to achieve an Annual Profit of 419%.


2. **Soil Quality Prediction**
   - **Description:** Experiment aimed to investigate the relationship between soil moisture and soil temperature with regards to various hyperspectral features. We performed multiple linear regression analysis and subsequently applied principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to improve the predictive performance of the regression models. The initial multiple linear regression model achieved an RMSE of 0.386 and an R-squared value of 0.855 for soil moisture prediction, and an RMSE of 0.473 and an R-squared value of 0.790 for soil temperature prediction. After applying PCA, we observed a notable improvement in the regression model's performance. The reduced models achieved an RMSE of 0.334 and an R-squared value of 0.888 for soil moisture and an RMSE of 0.383 and an R-squared value of 0.852. This reduction in RMSE and increase in R-squared indicate that the PCA-based dimensionality reduction effectively captured the essential information in the hyperspectral features, leading to more accurate and predictive regression models. These findings highlight the usefulness of PCA in reducing dimensionality and selecting informative components for regression analysis.

3. **Stellar Classification**
   - **Description:** The aim of this project was to classify three different stellar bodies namely Stars, Quasars, and Galaxies based on their spectral characteristics. The dataset used for this purpose was the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17. The dataset consists of 17 features and labels distinguishing each object into their respective classes. The problem was a multiclass classification consisting of three classes.
  
4. **Sentiment Analysis on Script Data**
   - **Description:** Utilized Python to scrape 50,000 lines of sitcom dialogue script data to gain insights on sentiment of main characters by episode. Implemented Regex techniques to comb through 240 episode scripts and identify key characters and dialogues. Conducted Sentiment Analysis using Python with Googleâ€™s Bert Large Language Model. Aggregated data using pandas and utilized data into Streamlit to build an episode sentiment categorization website.
